# Ricochette Online

## Description

This project is a implementation of my Ludum Dare 41 game called Ricochette. 

I'm converting the code from Unity 3D to Phaser 3 and will use socket.io to turn this game an online multiplayer one.

## Tools used

A this moment, i'm using Node js, phaser 3 and socket io to build the game. But I will probally divide this in two projects: one for client and other for server.

## Running project

To run this project, just clone it. After, run `npm install` to install the dependencies. 
Therefore, run `webpack` to build the code and after `node server.js` to serve the game in localhost.
